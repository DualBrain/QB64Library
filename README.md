# A collection of useful libraries for QB64
This collection of libraries was developed and has grown over the period of approximately one decade. Most of the libraries were created out of my own need for a particular purpose, but as many of it are of common use, I've decided to put this collection together for everybody.

**The main parts are:**

- Imageprocessing effects and filters
- Polygon drawing and analysis
- Stringbuffer Storage System
- LZW packing and unpacking
- MD5 and SHA2 hash generation
- DES-56 encryption and decryption
- several wrappers to standard library functions

#### Download the latest Release October/2021 right here: [QB64Library.7z](https://github.com/RhoSigma-QB64/QB64Library/raw/main/QB64Library.7z)

>**Make sure to move the extracted QB64Library folder with its entire contents into your QB64 folder (where qb64.exe is in). You find an overview of all libraries in the QB64Library-Info.html file.**
